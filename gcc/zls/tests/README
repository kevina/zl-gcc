This directory proves a snapshot of zl's generated output, both in "c"
and "zls".  Both version should produce identical assembly output
except for "prelude.c" which will only produce identical code with
"-O".  Any discrepancies are likely a bug and need to be looked into.

run-tests.sh is a quick and dirty shell script to compare the
assembly output of both versions.
